Parse and modify HCL documents while preserving whitespace and comments. This
crate is to HCL what [`toml_edit`](https://docs.rs/toml_edit) is to TOML. In
fact, its API is heavily inspired by `toml_edit`.

## Notice

**This crate is under heavy development right now** and the documentation as
well as usage examples are scarce. There's still a lot of planned functionality
missing and some APIs might even be cumbersome to use at the moment.

This will improve over time as this project evolves.

**Expect breaking changes at any time** until the biggest issues are fleshed out.
